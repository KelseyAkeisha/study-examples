{"study":{"studyId":24,"title":"MORE Simple Study Demo v01","purpose":"MORE is a unique platform for planning and supporting the execution of situated and potentially long-term studies that combine sensor data collection with questionnaires and offers the ability to configure \"adaptive interventions\" where incoming data or responses from study participants are evaluated and can trigger action responses (such as sending messages to study participants, triggering additional observations, etc.).\nThis study illustrates a demonstration use case of a one-week study that is simple but also conveys an impression of the range of capabilities of the platform.\nThe example contains a classic intervention study with two arms (or conditions / treatments, sometimes also called \"levels\") that explore the independent variable of \"physical activity (PA) support with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) vs. a control or baseline group \"without JITAIs\" (where only some general observations are carried out.","participantInfo":"Study Title:\nExploring the Efficacy of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Physical Activity Support: A One-Week Intervention Study\n\nDescription:\nThis study is designed to investigate the effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) on physical activity support over a one-week period. The study will compare two groups: one receiving JITAIs and the other serving as a control with general observations. You will be randomly assigned to one of these groups.\n\nParticipant Criteria:\nTo participate in this study, you must:\n\nBe aged 18–65 years.\nHave a smartphone compatible with the study app.\nBe willing to follow study procedures, including wearing a physical activity tracker.\nNot have any medical conditions that contraindicate physical activity.\nNot be currently participating in another physical activity study.\n\nStudy Arms:\nJITAI Group: Participants will receive personalized, adaptive messages and prompts to encourage physical activity based on real-time data.\nControl Group: Participants will not receive JITAIs but will have their physical activity levels monitored.\n\nTime Commitment:\nParticipants will be involved in the study for one week. During this time, they are expected to carry on with their usual activities while adhering to the study protocols.\n\nRisks and Benefits:\nThere are minimal risks associated with participation, primarily related to data privacy and the physical activity itself. Benefits include contributing to research on effective physical activity interventions and potentially improving one's own physical activity habits.\n\nConfidentiality:\nAll participant data will be confidential. Identifiable information will be separated from study data and securely stored. GDRP regulations will be adhered to. Upon study completion, data will be transferred from MORE into encrypted permanent storage at the INSITUTE. Data will always be encrypted in transport.\n\nCompensation:\nParticipants will receive a nominal compensation for their time and effort.\n\nContact Information:\nFor more information or to express interest in participating, please contact the study coordinator at [contact details].\n\nEthical Approval:\nThis study has been reviewed and approved by the [Institutional Review Board name], and it conforms to the ethical standards of research.\n\nPlease note that this is a hypothetical participant information section and the specifics might vary based on the actual study design and ethical requirements.","consentInfo":"Consent to Participate:\nBy choosing to continue with this digitally mediated study, participants acknowledge and give their informed consent to the following:\n\nData Collection and Use:\nParticipants agree to the collection of data regarding their physical activity levels through the use of a study app and activity tracker. This may include but is not limited to step count, heart rate, and activity duration.\n\nData Storage and Processing:\nAll data collected will be stored on secure servers located within the European Union during the study. Participants consent to the processing and storage of their data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nData Transfer and Permanent Storage:\nUpon completion of the study, data will be transferred to more permanent storage facilities located in Austria. Participants are informed of this transfer and the location of the storage.\n\nRight to Data Deletion:\nParticipants may request the deletion of their data up to two weeks following the completion of the study. After this period, data will be prepared for analysis and may no longer be retrievable.\n\nPseudonymization of Data:\nTo protect privacy, all participant data will be stored using a pseudonym. No personal identifying information will be linked to the data sets during analysis.\n\nPlatform Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:\nBy agreeing to participate, individuals also agree to the platform's terms of service and privacy policy, which detail the use, handling, and rights related to the platform and the participant's data.\n\nConfirmation:\nBy proceeding with the study, participants confirm that they have read, understood, and agree to all the terms outlined in this informed consent section. They are aware of their rights and the purpose of the data collection related to this study.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to keep a copy of this consent form for their records.\n\nPlease be aware that this is a template and should be customized to fit the specific legal and ethical requirements of the study, as well as the platform's terms of service and privacy policy.","finishText":"Thank You for Your Participation in Our Study – Next Steps and Information\n\nWe would like to extend our heartfelt thanks for your participation in the study \"Exploring the Efficacy of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Physical Activity Support.\" Your contribution has been invaluable, and we are grateful for the time and effort you have dedicated over the past week.\n\nNow that the study has concluded, we want to remind you of a few important points:\n\nData Deletion Request: Should you wish to have your data removed from our records, you have the option to request this until [specific date], which is two weeks from the study's completion date.
